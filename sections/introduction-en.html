<span class="markdown">Wine tourism has become a key form of tourism that integrates wine culture, gastronomy, heritage, and landscape. In response to this growing significance, the Wine Tourism Extension of the SEGITTUR Tourism Reference Conceptual Model has been developed to semantically integrate the specific elements of wine tourism within the conceptual framework defined by SEGITTUR.
This ontology extends the original model by incorporating classes and relationships that describe the agents, resources, products, and experiences related to wine tourism, enabling a homogeneous, interoperable, and reusable representation for tourism information systems, destination management platforms, and semantic analysis applications.
